        We're a new startup and still figuring out how to price our product. <br

        So,
        <strong>during our beta phase, it's completely free</strong>. We'd love
        to work with you to find a fair and competitive price that works for
        both of us once we launch. And don't worry, we'll keep you in the loop
        every step of the way!
