## Intro 

Have you ever wondered how your WiselyDesk virtual assistant can know more about your product than you?

We already explained <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wiselydesk.com/blog/how-does-wiselydesk-generate-the-answers">how WiselyDesk generates the AI answers</a> - but where does it get the information? 

With the sources feature, users are provided a link to the sources (in this case, Zendesk knowledge base articles) that informed the AI response.

## Sources


Each time a user asks a question, WiselyDesk identifies the most relevant knowledge base articles with similar meanings by comparing their word embeddings for semantic similarity (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.wiselydesk.com/blog/how-does-wiselydesk-generate-the-answers">blog explaination</a>). We then pass the content of those knowledge base articles to build the context for the AI to generate a response. 

If you or your users want to view the most likely sources of the AI response - then click the *Source* link.

### Note - "most likely sources"

"Most likely sources" mean that WiselyDesk provides the relevant knowledge base articles as context for the AI to construct its response. 

The tech industry currently lacks full visibility into the AI's reasoning. So nobody can guarantee with 100% certainty that the source was used to contruct the response.

Though, with effective engineering safety practices and correct prompting / bot instructions, we haven't seen sources being ignored by the virtual assistant. We will continue to monitor this with our beta customers. 

### Outro 

We hope to help increase the general knowledge of the capabilities and limitations of this new AI technology for the customer service industry. If you have any questions or topics you would like us to cover in the next blog post, please let us know!
